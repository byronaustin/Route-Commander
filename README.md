This application was designed to maintain a daily record of newspaper delivery addresses. 
The route is ordered. 
There are 2 modes of operation, automatic and manual. 

In manual mode, the "Next" button is pressed as a paper is delivered. The application reads the address of the next delivery
and announces it over the audio output of the IPAQ. The application then waits for the "Next" button to be pressed again. 

In the Auto mode, the application will read, in order all the addresses on a particular street, with a standard delay between 
each one. After completing a street, it will wait for the "Next" button to be pressed. 

The Application maintains a record of start and finish times each day. 

The operator can update the route list and it will take effect immediately so new starts or stops aren't missed.
